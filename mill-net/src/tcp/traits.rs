///
/// Handler methods are called from worker threads in the thread pool. Multiple
/// handlers may execute concurrently for different connections. Your implementation
/// should be efficient to avoid blocking worker threads.

/// ## Error Handling
///
/// Return errors from handler methods to indicate processing failures. The connection
/// will be closed automatically when handlers return errors from on_data.
